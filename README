C++ implementations using STL Associative Containers to manage data efficiently:
Unique Word Analyzer (Part 1): utilizes a std::set to read a text file and automatically filter and display all non-duplicate words in ascending order.
State Capital Lookup (Part 2): utilizes a std::map to store pairs of all 50 U.S. states and their capitals, providing an efficient lookup mechanism (O(logn)) for user queries.

Prerequisites
A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang, MSVC) that supports C++11 or later.
Basic understanding of C++ classes, templates, pointers, and object-oriented programming concepts.
